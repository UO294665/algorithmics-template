What does it mean that the time measured is 0?

That the time of the execution is so fast that it can't be measured, 
so it is not reliable.

From what size of problem (n) do we start to get reliable times?

From 7.000.000 aprox

What happens with the time if the problem size is multiplied by 2?

As it has a linear complexity, the time will be aprox the previous time *2.

What happens with the time if the problem size is multiplied by a value k other than 2? (try it, for
example, for k=3 and k=4 and check the times obtained)

The time will be the previous time *k as the algorithm has a linear complexity.

Explain whether the times obtained are those expected from the linear complexity O(n)

The times are so so the expected as the complexity was correct

matches1 : O(n^2) as it has two for loops anidated
matches2 : O(n) as it only iterates just one time
maximum : O(n) as it only iterates with just one for loop
sum : O(n) as it only uses one for loop
